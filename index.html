  We are the designing firm of ռǟʋɮǟռզ. Our main focus? Sustainability. Our core beliefs? Peace. Dignity. Equality. And Fun. <!--If you wish in one hand and work with the other
  you have a 50/50 shot at getting something done. Not all work is equal. Not all wishes are either. If you were to wish for a genie for every other within the universe, would
  the genie have anything left for to bar you from? A partnership for every person would make a war out of every potluck with a hot fuck. Patience, struggle, and contmplaton
  without the answer is all our fates. With an easy leg up the weak would fall from the top of a Pyramid of Nazi that electrocutes females for menstral cycles. I say crypto rape,
  psychic smother, blue until it brines. God's teeth are shoe-shined, not naturally white.
  <!--and we will someday have a generator that doubles as an excercise machine (a stationary bicycle, 
  coined the IKE BIKE system). With this and a water head turbine system we am concurrently designing, it would most likely make it so one never has to pay energy bills 
  ever again. You could save close to $200 a month once the system is properly prototype tested and able to be shared with the public. I own the design outright because 
  I derived the concept myself and though there may be other similar systems, mine will be available sometime within the next several years (today is 2025/04/25). If you 
  would like to contact me, I can be reached via email for questions via the contact page but please consider it somewhere you can speak freely to me. I am not particularly 
  interested in many things to do with business besides those which i have found that have helped me learn and create what gives me value as opposed to money generation 
  schemes that depend on hyper trading cryptocurrency or resources that are either held indefinitely in storage or shipped somewwhere else to do the same. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The page here has more trees within it's map and you may find value in my writing or music that I wrote, produced, recorded, digitized, and shared in various ways. I believe 
  the days of 1 million dollar record contracts are long gone so I don't expect much cash for music but the IKE BIKE power generator will be fairly expensive but you can know 
  the price more accurately once the design has been conceptualized and tested with a working prototype before it's production for others to use. We may activate the other pages
  linked in the header of the page for shirts, hats, and IRL EEFT-RPG gaming related products for sale. I don't know how to talk about the games but if you have any questions about
  them you can ask. They are not related to gambling. They are mostly simple proxy games you can play with others remotely while you do your normal daily errands and routine.

  The above design has been rejected by our conceptual design lead. ռǟʋɮǟռզ will continue designing other concepts and can be contacted if one would like consulting regarding 
  their designs or decision making.

  Now the design has been re-assesed with help from our purchasing department and may indeed make you lose your lunch on a simple cooling load for a quaint shack in Lumberton, NC.
  Just need a freight container and couple kilograms of distachya...

  We are content, at peace, and hungry for more. 50 years? why not 75? With enough focused materia, we could become a new species within 7 years of cell death and regrowth in 
  test subjects. Playstation. Need for Speed. Straight from the neo pit. Until you salt spit. From the horse shit. They'll feed the politicos. I say keep them fed and alive.
  So we can test on just five. So they can finally cry. Like a family that just got dry. We fell back into the barrel. And it's full of snail oil. That keeps your mind full of
  the magnet coil. Until we run out of aluminum foil. Oh right, I forgots. China has our back on the spots. Where the food is just a rouse. Where they play a real dirty loose. 
  That you can jimmy with a knot. Of a slip clutch I got. By meeting my maker and she is not. Just the one, it's the whole lot. And those that really fought. For freedom of the 
  speech so we could eat. At a table with she's peeps. And kiss her without even a touch. Or a mistep while we dance before lunch.

idea:
instead of password we make device keys. device keys can be an object which triggers the cryptographic interface/methodology such that it is still functional in front of the device’s 
GUI for security. i.e. the “phone” has a “cheaper than phone” frequency of proximity calculation to each other. you give the “phone” and “cheaper than phone” at the onset of the 
purchase. in cases where the “chaper than phone” is lost, the purchases could have to manage passwords again. but it teaches what it teaches. i wont say either way which is better 
but i will note password memorization is inclusive in puzzle ergo game theory so i understand the allure of password methodology and the games that are associated with it. but for 
high level security applications, high importance of success rate applications, and various other completions parameters you may want to explore this padding option for security 
and stability think this way: the “cheaper than phone” device sends a ping to the “phone” at a agreeable frequency, but can only unlock the phone with the “cheaper than phone” 
device within the appropriate proximity. when the ping isnt registered within the time change of each ping, the “phone” initiates a cryptographic methodology, or disconnects 
the battery such that it cant operate with the ping, or “bricks” “flashes in someones face a high lumens burst” or other options that obey the project’s design intent.

thank you for your continued attention to my cyber networking journey. i look forward to my path that includes your input/resources. i enjoy consulting with your teams.
