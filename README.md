ռǟʋɮǟռզ is a sustainability focused organization with ties to Navajo ancestery through my family. My father trained me as a medical practicioner and my mother trained me as an accountant so I became a medical consultant of conceptual design of the prototype. I strive to do the best I can for those whom have less and in doing so I get what I need.
