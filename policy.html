     This policy is subject to change at any time but will be updated as soon as possible when
     there are changes regarding our responsibilities to anyone accessing, generally surfing, or 
     donating to this web instance with respect to our work. <br/>
     You can consider this a zero warranty advisory discussion regarding these topics.
     We will begin design of the mandatory data collection parameters of visitors of our web designs
     and historical data. In general, best practices of previous conglomerate data aggrgators will be
     submitted to given there has been ample time for them to develop surfable mapping of their
     partnership parameters and privacy policies. For the most part, one should be confident that in 
     the event that one's web history can provide any sort of valuable data, I have allowed mine to be
     considered at this time in order to note any anomalies related to early (before the age of consent) adult 
     content and relationships online as well as my natural surfing and writing. In the event that other
     data is available, studies could be considered at this time given my understanding of my current active
     agreements at the time of this publication. I am unaware of any one person online that I consider a partner
     or cohort besides conglomerate business entities that do not identify themselves as being an active user but 
     instead utilize automation and AI to create progression within a navigation web of various promissory statements
     for creation of imaginary deliverables that may or may not create a wage in the future. For the most part, 
     this has been an educational exercise but it has recently become mutually beneficial in terms of partnerships
     with CashApp, Protonmail, Apple, Uber, DoorDash, Bank of America, State Farm, Duke Energy, Piedmont Natural Gas,
     Spectrum, AT&T, City of Charlotte Utilities, and the data conglomerates are within a perpetual clickling loop
     of promissory of imaginary deliverables based on conceptual design goading. The partners that have provided the
     most value have been those that developed independent and autonomous systems that respond to focused labor in order
     to create either motivation to continue IRL, a wage above that of a serf, or an essential resource with regards to 
     subsistence. In the case of the ladder we will note here that City of Charlotte Utilities is hereby declared deliquent
     the quality of resource necessary to continue as a partner that supplies water above the quality of that which 
     is essential to the subsitence of a human via ingestion. We will continue to pay for water from this entity for
     washing and hygeiene but it may be necessary for another entity to begin the steps necessary to begin court precedings
     with regards to the City of Charlotte Utilities and its adherence to the IPCC protocols with regards to providing
     drinking water to the population of Charlotte. I have not tested said water with a kit but it is clear at this
     point within the study that this entity has had ample time to create a plan related to public safety with the 
     departments of law enforcement in tandem with independent security forces, medical personnel, and fire safety for the 
     loop of Charlotte. In the event that this decision has unforeseen negative downstream effects, it could be said
     that it is not an essential action item at this time. The local grocery chains have ample supply of high quality
     water and this should not be considered an emergency situation. Water quality at an average home does not cause noticeable 
     corrosion of piping systems but it has, within the term of this study, rendered a 50 gallon water heater tank unusable
     over 15 years of regular use via calcium chloride deposit clogging. The water heater was inoperable and was replaced around
     2018 and could be an indicator of average calcium chloride levels if it is rendered unusable again via flow approximations. 
     As of now a 15 year flow approximation created close to 1 pound of calcium chloride deposits. The class can attempt to
     bring suit via fluid approximations from those approximations. But I digress, on to gaming. <br>
     The above score be for the class of the su-core. We do adore our rapport with more of the store of a data whores.
     Perhaps mishaps regarding snap traps that threat the clap were an attack on the back of a baby without a lady. Or 
     it may be that the tv taught of many things that be between a lady and their young. To kiss when your lips are sick
     make the whole world trick us for a treat of the b's once every 3 meets. If you can be a man or another gender, have 
     yourself a bender of the ice and salt to fend off assault of the sexual nature. The salt it seems causes deposit reams
     but ice can freeze your attention on yourself and it's better to do that than to pile crap on another when your lacking the 
     motivation to labor without thinking of the end. The ice can be cut with these, a filler and capsule to slow uptake. It is 
     called a medication ball of ridilin or Adderal. The drip of this can be a kiss that fades as well and teaches patience to 
     even a master of many things. Then partnerships that promise the Ritz can seem silly and full of fluff. If even partnerships
     can't coo a kiss, what are we to do without water? Every one, needs a mother and father but not a kissing buddy. This can cause
     a sick of naus, felt the world round. Until we wait and masturbate, we will never know of another. <br>
     If one visits this, or any other web instance for that matter, their data will be measured. If you have any questions
     about that measurement, read and learn. If you don't know after that and you haven't been able to ASK a question, I don't
     believe you. b of pages that are hosted on Github and connect
     to the other websites listed. When unaware of what to collect, we default to fiscal records 
     of those which we invest our charitable/educational finance in order to establish proof of
     our motives and protect ourselves from any unnecessary tax burdens. One that is interested
     in knowing how their data is collected, utilized, and shared should make themselves familiar
